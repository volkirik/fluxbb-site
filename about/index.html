		<h3>About the FluxBB Project <small>FluxBB is a mature forum software platform developed by the FluxBB Group</small></h3>
		
		<p>FluxBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public Licence. It is free to download and 
		use and will remain so. FluxBB was conceived and designed to be fast and light with less of the "not so essential" 
		features that some of the other forums have whilst not sacrificing essential functionality or usability.</p>

		<p>FluxBB is a fork of PunBB, which was created by Rickard Andersson. In 2007 PunBB was sold to a commercial company. 
		Development continued under the direction of Rickard Andersson until April 2008. At that time Rickard Andersson announced 
		he would be ceasing his active involvement with the project.</p>

		<p>In light of the changed circumstances the remaining members of the development team decided they needed to exert more 
		control over the direction of the project which meant the only option was to fork the project; hence FluxBB.</p>

		<p>The FluxBB v1.2 branch is an update to PunBB v1.2.17, fixing various issues.</p>

		<p>In June 2010 we released the long awaited FluxBB v1.4.0, bringing quite a few important features and improvements. In 
		the months that follows, we launched 9 updates for the 1.4 branch. In May 2012, we launched FluxBB v1.5.0, which included 
		improvements against spam.</p>
